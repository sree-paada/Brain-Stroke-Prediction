# Brain-Stroke-Prediction

**Brain Stroke Prediction using Machine Learning** 

This is a machine learning project in this repository that will predict the risk of a patient developing a stroke based on a number of health and lifestyle parameters they have. Through the use of data-driven insights, this project will help in identifying high-risk persons in their early stages. 

**Project Overview** 

World Health Organization (WHO) reports that stroke is the 2 nd major cause of mortality in the world. This project uses the past records of patients in order to develop a classification model that forecasts the presence of stroke depending on the characteristics of age, gender, hypertension, heart disease and BMI.  

**Dataset** 

The dataset used in this project includes 11 clinical features: 

* Gender: Male, Female, or Other. 

* Age: Age of the patient. 

* Hypertension: 0 if the patient doesn't have high blood pressure, 1 if they do. 

* Heart Disease: 0 if the patient doesn't have any heart diseases, 1 if they do. 

* Ever Married: "No" or "Yes". 

* Work Type: children, Govt_jov, Never_worked, Private, or Self-employed. 

* Residence Type: Rural or Urban. 

* Avg Glucose Level: Average glucose level in blood. 

* BMI: Body Mass Index. 

* Smoking Status: formerly smoked, never smoked, smokes, or Unknown. 

* Stroke (Target): 1 if the patient had a stroke, 0 if not. 

 

**Key Features** 

* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualization of health trends and correlations using Seaborn and Matplotlib. 

* Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature scaling. 

* Handling Imbalanced Data: Implementation of techniques like SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) to address the minority class (stroke cases). 

* Model Implementation: Comparison of various algorithms including: 

* Logistic Regression 

* Random Forest Classifier 

* Support Vector Machine (SVM) 

* XGBoost 

* Evaluation: Detailed performance report using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and Confusion Matrix.
